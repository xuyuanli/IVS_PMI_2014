User guideline:    

This is the guideline for the program ‘IVS_PMI_2014’.   

1. Objective of this program:
This program is compiled for the improved partial mutual information based input variable selection (PMI IVS) with the consideration of boundary issues associate with bandwidth estimation.  The detail theory and discussion can be referred to ‘Li, X., Zecchin, A.C., Maier, H.R., 2014. Improving Partial Mutual Information-based input variable selection by consideration of boundary issues associated with bandwidth estimation. Environmental Modelling and Software, submitted on 04/12/2014.’



2.  How to use this program:
This program can be run on windows PGI visual FORTRAN 2008 (or lower version) and Linux 2.6.32.2.

2.1 On windows 
	Prepare input files (see the example file ‘EAR4_NORM.txt’);  
The format is: 
1st line:  No. of data in each input      No. of input    ( e.g.  1000   3 )
2nd line:  Input 1    input 2   input 3   output     ( e.g  Input(1,1)   Input(1,2)  Input(1,3)  output(1)  )   
3rd line:  Input 1    input 2   input 3   output     ( e.g  Input(2,1)   Input(2,2)  Input(2,3)  output(2)   )  
⋮
1000th line: Input 1   input 2  input 3  output  ( e.g  Input(1000,1)   Input(1000,2)  Input(1000,3)  output(1000)  )   
(*Please also see the example file ‘EAR4_NORM.txt’);
(*If there are 30 repeats and each repeat contains 500 data, put all 30*500 data in the input file  and the No. of data in each input is 30*500);
	Compile and execute the ‘IVS_PMI_BSBC_2014.pvfproj’ file ;
	Select the PMIIVS with the proposed estimators for MI and RE; see the suggestions on the screen;
	Type in the no. of repeating tests; this program allows any number of repeats; 
	Check the output files;
	
2.2 On Linux
	Build program file and load all f90 files and input files (see the example file ‘EAR4_NORM.txt’);
	Write a batch file or simply link the program with the following code:
‘ifort PSOmod.f90 GLS.f90 1PMIB1.f90 2PMIB2.f90 3PMIR5.f90 4PMIR7
.f90 IVSPMI_2014main.f90 -o test1.run;
	Execute  ‘test1.run’;

	Select the PMIIVS with the proposed estimators for MI and RE; see the suggestions on the screen;
	Type in the no. of repeating tests; this program allows any number of repeats; 
	Check the output files;

Except the four recommended methods, you can also use the other twelve tested methods by simply linking the name of the module to the main program and call the PMI based subroutine in the main program. It needs to be aware that 
	the PSO searching parameters (used in R7, C4) can change based on user’s preference  (as highlighted)
i.e. 
Searching range of each variable:
 SUBROUTINE ‘PSOA0’, ‘PSOA1’, ‘PSOA2’, ‘PSOA3’, CALL ComputeObjectiveFunction0
(ix,oy,r,c,(-10.0000+20.0000*(swarm%particle(j)%x)),f)
sp(i)=-10.0000+20.0000*swarm%GB(1)%x(i) 

PSO searching behaviour:
      SUBROUTINE set_PSO_parameters(swarm)
              USE mod_PSO, ONLY: type_PSO_swarm
              TYPE(type_PSO_swarm), INTENT(INOUT) :: swarm
              ! Control Parameters
    swarm%NeighbourhoodFlag = 'vonNeumannU'   ! Type of neighbouthood structure
	swarm%Nparticle         = 100                          ! Number of particles
	swarm%Nelite            = 2                                 ! Number of elitist particles
	swarm%NImax             = 100                           ! Maximum number of iterations
	swarm%Nx                = 4                                   ! Size of decision string 
	! Standard searching parameters
	swarm%cNB               = 2.0		    ! Weighting coefficient for GB particle 
	swarm%cPB               = 2.0		    ! Weighting coefficient for PB particle
	swarm%cInertiaMax       = 0.9		    ! Maximum inertia coefficient
	swarm%cInertiaMin       = 0.4		    ! Minimum inertia coefficient
	swarm%vMax              = 0.5		    ! Velocity component bound
	! Secondary searching parameters (not needed unless difficult problem, set swarm%perturbNI > swarm%NImax to not use)
	swarm%perturbExp        = 5.0		    ! Perturbation Exponent
	swarm%perturbProb       = 0.20		    ! Perturbation Probability
	swarm%perturbEs         = 0.000005	    ! Expected value for start
	swarm%perturbEe         = 0.0000000005	    ! Expected value for end
	swarm%perturbNI         = 10001		    ! Start iteration for perturbation
END SUBROUTINE set_PSO_parameters 
	The application of M2 needs R-Fortran.



3. Outputs:
Be aware that all output files can be replaced, so backup all results after the tests.
	File 1: Test_detailoutput1.txt; include rank of inputs, MI/PMI values, and significate inputs of each test;
	File 2: Test_summaryoutput1.txt; include no. of significant inputs, order of inputs, PMI values, and computational cost of all tests;
